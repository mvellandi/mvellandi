This entails whatever it takes to make customers happy, reduce expenses, and increase revenue.

I am a web developer skilled in the following:

- **Languages**: Elixir, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend**: LiveView, React, Tailwind
- **Frameworks**: Phoenix, Next.js
- **Design**: Figma
- **CMS**: Sanity

While these are my current strengths, I have used other languages and tech and can quickly pick up new ones.
Currently, I am learning TypeScript.
