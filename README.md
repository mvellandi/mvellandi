Hi! I&apos;m a software engineer with a strong orientation toward product development and UX design. In the last few years, I've built up a portfolio, helped a professional client, and completed a 3-month training for software development.

Aside from the tech skills below I&apos;m confident with, I can quickly learn and apply new ones.

- **Languages**: Elixir, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend**: LiveView, React, Tailwind
- **Frameworks**: Phoenix, Next.js
- **Design**: Figma
- **CMS**: Sanity

Lastly, I carry forward project management and writing skills from my previous career in content strategy.

Please [contact me](https://www.vellandi.net/contact) if you'd like to chat about your project or just want to say hello.
To see my portfolio, writing, and learn more about me:
